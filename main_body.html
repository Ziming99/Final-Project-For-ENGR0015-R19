    Welcome to the Pear Woodworking LLC webpage
We established this company with the goal of becoming the premier lumberyard and contracting outlet in the United States and we are proud to say that we are well on our way. Located in Washington DC, we employ 120 people as well as subcontracting many others who live in the northeastern United States. Pear Woodworking LLC was founded in 2019 by Ziming Li, Pardeep Singh, and Lawrence Blumenthal all of whom have a passion for creation.</font></p>
<font color="white"><br>Where we are:<br><br>
This location was carefully selected for two important reasons regarding our business. The first reason is that based on population census data Washington DC is relatively close to the average density center of the United States. These factors make travel out of and into the city much easier and minimize the amount of time that is wasted on travel arrangements moving between locations. The second reason is the southeastern mixed forest’s northern tip begins in Virginia, stretches into the Carolinas, then reaches its densest point in northern Georgia. This allows our operational supervision to go off without a hitch and makes the subcontracting easier as well.</font>
<p><font color="red"><br>Our process:<br><br>
Our process begins by cutting down trees beginning in northern Virginia, and eventually concluding the initial cycle in eastern Louisiana before starting over again. This entails cutting down the trees in the region that we have presently settled after carefully calculating the amount that we need for each of the projects we have undertaken. The initial stage begins with the cutting down of trees for our lumber so that we can build homes create furniture and sell to contractors who use our product. After the trees have been cut down, we ship the lumber off to the mill to get appropriately sized and cut for the projects that they are needed for. 
However, our work in these regions is not concluded; we take care to dig up the stumps and chip the roots into mulch so that none of the components are wasted. After the soil and surrounding grounds have been cleared of the remnants of tree, we contract one of the nurseries that we partner with to replace the trees that we cut down (primarily Oak trees in this region). We purchase as many trees as we have cut down to replace what we took and move on only when assured that the soil is fertile enough to accommodate the new saplings. Afterwards we repeat this process in next region to the allowing the trees that we have planted several decades to grow and restore the balance to the surrounding environment.
